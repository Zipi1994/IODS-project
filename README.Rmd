# Introduction to Open Data Science

This is my course project for an introductory course in Data Science. On this course I will learn how to use RStudio, GitHub and DataCamp. And hopefully a thing or two about working with data resources. 

You can find my course diary [here](https://Zipi1994.github.io/IODS-project/).
